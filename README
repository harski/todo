TODO
====

todo is a tool meant for handling tasks and notes. It reads the
directory $HOME/.todo and interpretes the files inside as TodoItems. The
items need to have a specific format as described below.

`todo -t` will print items for the current day and the ones that were
due in the past but arent marked as done. `todo -a` will print out
agenda, i.e. items for the next (by default) eight days. See `todo -h`
for other actions and options.
